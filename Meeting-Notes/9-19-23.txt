Meeting log for 9-19-23 for anyone who was not here and is interested:

Today we started the Star Catcher tutorial project on WoofJs.com.
A link to my copy of the code and game can be found at https://woofjs.com/create.html#HSHSProg-Star-Catcher

We went over variables, how to detect the mouse clicking, and how to display basic text on the screen. 
After using that to create what you see at the link (If I have not gone back and changed it since), everyone attempted to finish the tutorial on their own.
This includes making a timer, that ticks down once every second and then once it hits 0, ends the game or restarts it for continued play.

If you are stuck and would like an explanation of that, I will provide one below. 
You can also send a message on our canvas, or check the tutorial keys in the WoofJs folder in this repo.

To make a timer, we can do the same as the score and create a variable with a text connected to it:

let time = 20
let timerText = new Text({
    text: () => "Time Left: "+time
})

and then in order to make it tick once per second, we can use the every function: 

every(1, 'second', () => {
  //Decrement time and check if it is 0, if so end the game.
  time--
  if(time == 0) {
    time = 20
    score = 0
  }
})

The above is a basic example of what to do if the timer hits 0, all it does is reset the time to 20 seconds and reset the score.
You can change that to do whatever you want! Don't worry about the if statment, we will go over those and how to use them next meeting.

See y'all next meeting!
