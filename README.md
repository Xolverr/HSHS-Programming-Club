# Programming Club
## This repository is for all things Programming Club related, for teaching material, templates for projects, and more!
Programming Club is a new club at HSHS with the goal of teaching complete beginners programming!
Feel free to use this teaching material, or modify it to suit your own needs!

## How do I use this repository?
In order to use this repository to its fullest potential, you will want acess to the teaching material.
The teaching material is located within the TeachingMaterial folder, and will be organized into sub-folders for different lessons/topics.
Each lesson folder will be its own project, complete with everything needed to set it up with a personal IDE, and instructions on how to use it if it expects you to use an external IDE.

## Who can use this material? Are there any hardware limitations?
I will try my best to ensure all material is as accessible as I can, however more complex topics will expect you to have a computer that can run an actual IDE, alongside install anything required for the project or lesson. (Examples, Node packages, language compilers/runtimes, etc.)
Anything expected to be installed will be detailed, with instructions on how to easily install them. The basic introduction lessons and projects will be available to people with School provided Chromebooks, provided the websites we will be using are not blocked.
